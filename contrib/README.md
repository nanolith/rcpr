Contributed Software Licenses
=============================

Some of the software in this library was adapted from open source software
written by others.  This document is a reference of these contributions.

Boost Context Library
---------------------

The fiber library makes use of some of the Boost::Context library.  While the
code used is adapted from the original for the purpose of this library, this
code should be considered a derived work, and as such, is credited to the
original author, Oliver Kowalke.  Note that the portions of code used are for
the assembler functions `fiber_make` and `fiber_jump`.  Everything else is
original to RCPR.
